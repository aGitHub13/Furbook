            I have a black and white cat named Skyler. Skyler is a demon in a
            cats body that likes to sleep all day and scratch people. But thats
            what I love about her :)

            Theres this one time a dog bit me but I didn't get rabies. But thats
            ok because rabies is bad. Dogs are cool and they're called "man's
            best friend."

            Ok so cats and dogs are known by everyone to not like each other,
            but in my opinion dogs just bully cats because they're smaller and
            they have the instinct to get smaller animals like squirrels. Also,
            cats tend to run away from danger which triggers a dogs instict to
            run after it. Mr. Lance give me a good grade on this i researched
            this
